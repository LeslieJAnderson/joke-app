2. Make it so that you can clear all of your votes
3. Make the joke list clickable so you can either click 'previous' and 'next' or click on a joke to change which joke you're viewing
4. Make the app work for the given jokes plus knock-knock jokes and joke-like one-liners
   example of a joke-like one-liner: `Whatever your opinion is on React, you've gotta give it props.`
5. Make it possible for jokes to have an alternate punchline that's viewable on hover
   example: `{id: 19, setup: "What streets do ghosts haunt?", punchline: "Dead ends", altPunchline: "Boo-levards" isFunny: undefined}`
6. Make it so that you can hide/reveal the `JokeList`
7. Make it so that as you click 'next' through the jokes, the joke you're current on is always visible in the `JokeList`
8. Make entering a name mandatory
9. Make the app alert the user saying a name is mandatory if user tries to continue without entering a name

    B. Give rating percentages. Eg, 30% funny, 50% not funny, 20% unrated
    C. List the jokes with their ratings. Hint, you can re-use the `JokeList` component here.
